## Lessons Learned
1. **Perspective:** Evaluate from user's view (actual UI), not code logic
2. **Be Proactive:** Report blockers immediately, don't wait to be asked
3. **Flight searches:** Always verify round-trip vs one-way, and per-person vs total price
4. **Google Flights:** Prices vary wildly by date — always check the date grid
