# Pre-Compaction Context — Lost and Recovered
## Saved: 2026-02-02 11:42 PM (Paul re-provided after compaction wiped it)

## Task-Specific Answers Paul Gave BEFORE Compaction

### 1. Espar Heater (440975803)
- Boat heater, model D5WS
- Has the parts already
- **Needs a VIDEO, not text guide**

### 2. optimlfitness.com Transfer (443013657)
- Already had Cloudflare access (set up yesterday)
- Waiting for nameserver propagation, then paste EPP code + add payment
- Henry already had access — should have DONE it, not researched generic steps

### 3. Tesla Integration (443057574)
- Model S
- Already has Tessie software — should integrate with that
- Also looking at HA integration

### 4. Outbound Voice Calling (443138004)
- **DO NOT BREAK INBOUND** — spent all day configuring and tuning
- Just make outbound MATCH the inbound pipeline
- Don't create separate scripts — mirror the architecture

### 5. Mission Control — Full Design Discussion

**Tech:** Next.js + Tailwind dark theme, hosted on Vercel
**Auth:** External access needed (Paul isn't on the VM much)
**GitHub:** New repo under HenryHeth

**Tabs (in priority order):**
1. **Docs** (priority 1) — research reports, phone transcripts, Telegram logs
   - Sidebar with file list, tag filters, file type badges, search
   - Right content pane (Obsidian-like, matching screenshot from video)
2. **Tasks** — summary dashboard (velocity, overdue, streaks) + links to Toodledo
3. **Captures** — Telegram + phone call logs
4. **Memory** — MEMORY.md, daily notes, searchable
5. **Mission Control** — homepage with bar charts (desk, screen, pulse)
6. **People** — contacts context
7. **Projects** — DROPPED (covered by Toodledo subtasks)

**Paul said:** "get a good first cut going for tomorrow and we will go from there"
**Paul offered:** credentials for server setup if needed
**Vercel:** already logged in

### 6. Voice Triage Sessions
- Twice weekly, 10 tasks per session
- Paul asked: calendar events or cron jobs?
- (Henry created both — calendar events + cron reminders)

### 7. Reporting Promise (Henry committed to this)
1. Toodledo task notes — update with what was done, links, next steps
2. memory/2026-02-03.md — log in TOMORROW's daily file
3. Research outputs → memory/research_*.md + uploaded to Google Drive
4. Morning briefing includes "Henry's Deliverables" section

## Lesson
Compaction wiped all of this. Henry charged ahead without these answers and delivered wrong output on 4+ tasks. Should have re-asked after compaction.
