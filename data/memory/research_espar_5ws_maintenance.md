## How It Works

The Espar Hydronic D5 is a diesel-fired coolant heater that works like a small boiler:
- Burns diesel fuel in a combustion chamber
- Heats coolant (antifreeze/water mix) circulating through the system
- Coolant is pumped through fan-coil heat exchangers placed throughout the boat
- Each heat exchanger has a small fan that blows warm air into the cabin
- Can also be plumbed to heat the domestic hot water tank

**Key components:** Combustion chamber → burner/flame tube → heat exchanger body → coolant circulation pump → fuel metering pump → glow plug/pin (igniter) → atomizer screen → control unit → thermostat/controller

**Output:** ~17,000 BTU (5 kW), suitable for boats up to ~13 meters (43 ft)

---

## Routine Maintenance Schedule

### Monthly (Year-Round — Critical!)
- **Run the heater for 15–30 minutes at HIGH**, even in summer
  - Burns off carbon deposits in combustion chamber
  - Prevents O-ring decay from drying out
  - Keeps fuel in lines from gelling/solidifying
  - Prevents corrosion in the water jacket
  - Confirms heater will start when you actually need it
  - *Espar service techs recommend running at 100°F+ output for 30 min, once per month*

### Pre-Season (Annually, Before Heating Season)
This is the big one. Do this every fall before you need heat:

1. **Electrical system check**
   - Inspect all wiring from heater to batteries for wear/abrasion
   - Clean battery terminal corrosion
   - Check fuse rating and condition
   - Verify all connectors are tight and corrosion-free

2. **Coolant system check**
   - Check expansion tank level (should be ~half full when cold)
   - Inspect all hose clamps — tighten as needed
   - Check all hoses for cracks, chafing, leaks
   - Clear clogged weep holes on heater body
   - Check for coolant stains/leaks below the unit

3. **Fuel system check**
   - Clean or replace fuel pump filter (FMP filter)
   - Verify fuel pump mounting angle is 15–35° (not horizontal!)
   - Check fuel lines for leaks, loose clamps, cracking
   - Confirm adequate fuel in tank (no sludge at pickup)
   - Perform fuel quantity check if possible

4. **Exhaust system check**
   - Inspect exhaust pipe for holes, breaks, corrosion
   - Check exhaust outlet for obstructions (mud dauber nests, debris, salt buildup)
   - Verify all exhaust connections are tight
   - Check through-hull fitting

5. **Combustion air intake check**
   - Inspect air intake for blockages
   - Clean or replace air filter if equipped

6. **Replace atomizer screen** (glow pin screen)
   - This is a **yearly consumable** — replace every season
   - Clean the glow pin screen chamber with a brush before installing new screen
   - Ensure ventilation hole on side of glow pin chamber is clear

7. **Inspect glow plug/pin**
   - Remove and visually inspect
   - Replace if discolored, distorted, or showing signs of wear
   - Glow plugs cloud over time and need replacement; ceramic glow pins last longer

8. **Coolant pump inspection**
   - Remove pump, check impeller for damage
   - Clean metal particles from impeller magnet
   - Clean pump cavity
   - Replace O-rings on pump housing if any leakage suspected

9. **Flame tube / combustion chamber inspection**
   - Remove flame tube, check condition
   - Should be light brown — not heavily carboned
   - Check burner "nose" at cold end for carbon covering air slots
   - Scrape loose carbon from between heat exchanger fins
   - Replace all gaskets on reassembly

10. **Test run** — run heater 15–20 minutes, verify normal operation

### Every 500 Hours (or as indicated by service alert)
- Replace atomizer screen
- Full service kit installation
- Download and clear fault codes
- Check blower motor speed

### Every 3,000 Hours (Service Life Interval)
- Major overhaul recommended
- Espar rates the S3 series service life at 3,000 hours (commercial version: 5,000 hours)
- Full-time liveaboards can hit this in ~2 years of continuous winter use
- Consider complete combustion chamber, pump, and control unit assessment

## Common Failure Points

### 1. Carbon Buildup in Combustion Chamber (Most Common)
- **Cause:** Running at low settings for extended periods, poor fuel quality, infrequent use
- **Symptoms:** White smoke from exhaust, failure to start, Fault Code 52 (Safety Time Exceeded)
- **Prevention:** Monthly high-temp runs; use clean diesel; avoid constant low-setting operation
- **Fix:** Kerosene cleaning procedure or manual disassembly

### 2. Coolant Leaks / Low Coolant
- **Cause:** Loose hose clamps, deteriorated O-rings, cracked water jacket
- **Symptoms:** Empty expansion tank, grinding noise, burning smell, over-temp shutdown
- **Prevention:** Annual hose clamp check, O-ring replacement, check expansion tank level monthly
- **Fix:** Tighten clamps, replace O-rings, refill and bleed system

### 3. Clogged Atomizer Screen
- **Cause:** Carbon deposits from combustion, especially with low-quality fuel
- **Symptoms:** Difficulty starting, white smoke, poor combustion
- **Prevention:** Replace annually (it's a cheap consumable)
- **Fix:** Replace screen — takes 15 minutes with proper tool

### 4. Glow Plug/Pin Failure
- **Cause:** Age, thermal cycling, voltage issues (>9.5V damages glow plug!)
- **Symptoms:** Failure to ignite, multiple start attempts, eventual lockout
- **Prevention:** Check voltage during service; inspect annually
- **Fix:** Replace glow plug/pin

### 5. Fuel Delivery Problems
- **Cause:** Clogged fuel filter, air in fuel lines, incorrect pump angle, dirty fuel tank, water in fuel
- **Symptoms:** Failure to start, sputtering, shutdown during operation
- **Prevention:** Clean fuel, annual filter service, correct pump mounting (15–35°), check fuel lines for air leaks
- **Fix:** Replace filter, prime lines, correct pump angle, clean fuel tank

### 6. Coolant Pump Failure
- **Cause:** Wear, contaminated coolant, debris on impeller
- **Symptoms:** Over-temp shutdown, no heat despite combustion, grinding noise

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Heater Won't Start
1. Check battery voltage (needs >10.5V for 12V system)
2. Check fuse — replace if blown (correct amperage!)
3. Listen for fuel pump ticking — if silent, check pump wiring/fuse
4. Check fuel level in tank
5. Inspect exhaust outlet for blockage
6. Check for fault codes on controller
7. If multiple failed starts → may be in **lockout** (10 failed attempts = lockout)
   - Clear lockout: remove heater fuse for 30 sec, reinstall
   - Or use EasyStart Pro: Settings → Workshop → unlock
8. If still won't start after 4-5 attempts: **STOP** — excessive fuel in chamber creates fire risk. Get professional help.

### Heater Starts Then Shuts Down
1. Check coolant level — low coolant causes over-temp shutdown
2. Check that all valves in coolant loop are OPEN
3. Verify coolant pump is running (feel for vibration/flow in hoses)
4. Check fuel filter for clogging
5. Inspect atomizer screen — replace if due
6. Check exhaust for restriction

### White Smoke from Exhaust
- **Too much fuel** reaching combustion chamber
- Replace atomizer screen
- Check/replace fuel filter
- May indicate carbon buildup — do kerosene cleaning

### Black Smoke from Exhaust
- **Not enough fuel** reaching combustion chamber
- Check fuel lines and pump for air leaks
- Check fuel filter
- Inspect fuel metering pump

### Heater Runs But No/Low Heat
1. Check coolant level and circulation pump operation
2. Verify all zone valves are open
3. Check that fan-coil heat exchangers are running (fans spinning)
4. Bleed air from coolant system (air pocket prevents flow)
5. Check thermostat setting and sensor operation

### Unusual Noises
- **Grinding:** Coolant pump failure or combustion blower bearing
- **Ticking (fast):** Normal — that's the fuel metering pump
- **Rattling:** Loose mounting, exhaust pipe vibration
- **Squealing:** Blower motor bearing or belt (if equipped)

### Burning Smell / Hot Smell
- **STOP THE HEATER**
- Check for coolant leak — low coolant causes overheating
- Inspect exhaust connections for leaks
- Check that exhaust is not near flammable materials
- **Always have CO detector and fuel vapor detector installed on board**

## Winterization & Off-Season Care

### If Boat Is Used Year-Round (Liveaboard)
- Monthly runs at high are your main maintenance
- Top up coolant before winter season
- Do full pre-season service in fall
- Keep spare atomizer screen and gasket set aboard

### If Laying Up for Winter (Boat Out of Water)
1. Run heater at high for 30 minutes as final burn
2. **Coolant must be proper antifreeze mix** — verify protection level for expected temperatures
   - Standard mix: 50/50 antifreeze/distilled water (protects to about -34°F / -37°C)
   - Use **extended life coolant** — match what's already in the system
3. Do NOT drain hydronic system unless specifically needed — antifreeze protects against freeze and corrosion
4. If draining: flush with fresh antifreeze mix before next season, bleed all air
5. Disconnect or cap exhaust outlet to prevent nesting insects
6. Cap air intake
7. Ensure battery will be maintained (trickle charger) or disconnect

### Spring Recommissioning
1. Remove exhaust/intake caps
2. Check coolant level — top up if needed
3. Inspect all hose clamps
4. Check exhaust system
5. Run heater for 15–20 minutes to verify operation
6. If heater fails to start after storage: check for insects in exhaust, stale fuel, dead battery

### Off-Season Monthly Run
Even if boat is dockside or on the hard:
- Run heater once a month, 15–30 min at high setting
- This is the **single most important maintenance habit** for Espar longevity
- Prevents seized pumps, dried O-rings, clogged fuel lines, carbon buildup

## Kerosene Carbon Cleaning Procedure

This is a widely recommended DIY maintenance procedure for removing carbon buildup:

### Steps:
1. Replace glow pin screen with new one first
2. Clean glow pin screen chamber with brush
3. Ensure ventilation hole on chamber side is clear
4. Disconnect fuel line from **inlet side** of fuel pump
5. Connect a temporary fuel line from pump inlet to a container of **kerosene**
6. ⚠️ Keep kerosene container **away from exhaust outlet and air intake** — hot carbon particles will exit exhaust!
7. ⚠️ Keep all flammable materials away from exhaust area
8. Start heater — may take several attempts to prime
9. Set to **maximum temperature / highest setting** (open doors/hatches to keep calling for heat)
10. Run for **25–30 minutes** at max
11. Turn off heater, let it complete cool-down cycle
12. Reconnect original fuel line
13. Resume normal operation

**Note:** Some heaters with severe carbon buildup won't start on kerosene and will need manual disassembly by a professional.
