RESEARCH REPORT: MORNING SUMMARY EMAIL FOR PAUL

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report outlines the design for "The Morning Brief," a daily digest email from Henry III to Paul. The design prioritizes dyslexia-friendly readability, mobile scanning, and high-value information density without clutter.

PROPOSED SEND TIME: 7:00 AM
Reasoning: Catches Paul before the school run (Seycove/St. Thomas Aquinas) and morning activities, but late enough to include fresh snow reports and overnight emails.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. RESEARCH & ANALYSIS

BENCHMARK EXAMPLES
I analyzed executive briefing formats from industry leaders (BaseHQ, Axios Smart Brevity) and productivity tools.

EFFECTIVE ELEMENTS FOUND
- "The One Thing": A single sentence summary of the day.
- Card-Based Layouts: Distinct sections separated by whitespace.
- Visual Hierarchy: Large, clear headings with much smaller body text.
- No "Walls of Text": Paragraphs capped at 2-3 lines.
- Negative Space: Generous margins are critical for cognitive load reduction.

DYSLEXIA-FRIENDLY DESIGN CONSTRAINTS
- Font: Sans-serif only (Verdana, Arial). No serifs.
- Contrast: Dark grey on Off-White to reduce glare.
- Justification: Left-aligned text only. Never fully justified.
- Scanning: Capitalize or spacing for key terms. Avoid visual noise like italics.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. THE DESIGN STRATEGY

SUBJECT LINE: [Day], [Date] - [Weather Summary]
(Example: Tuesday, Feb 4 - Rain in N. Van, 15cm Snow at Whistler)

LAYOUT STRUCTURE (MOBILE FIRST)
1. HEADER: Greeting + Date + Weather (Big, visual)
2. SNOW REPORT: Immediate "Go/No-Go" data for skiing.
3. THE KIDS: Ailie & Parker's logistics.
4. YOUR DAY: Combined Calendar & Tasks.
5. BRIEFING: Email digest & status checks.
