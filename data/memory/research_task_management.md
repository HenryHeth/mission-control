Paul Task Management Overhaul Plan

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This plan shifts you from "managing lists" to "managing energy." The goal is less desk time, more flow.

We replace the endless Toodledo backlog with a 2-Week Sprint model. If it doesn't fit in the sprint, it stays in the Backlog (Icebox) and doesn't clutter your daily view.

1. MISSION, VISION & VALUES

Mission Statement
To be a present, energized father and husband who models an active life of curiosity and connection, grounded in the freedom of "Enough."

Core Values
- Vitality First: Health (sleep, training, nutrition) is the engine for everything else.
- Present Connection: Being there for Jen, Ailie, and Parker beats clearing the inbox.
- Active Curiosity: Learning through doing (skiing, sailing, AI) rather than passive consumption (YouTube).
- Ruthless Simplicity: If it doesn't serve the mission, delete or automate it.

Decision Cascade
When a new task appears, ask:
1. Does this support my Vitality or Family? -> Schedule it.
2. Is this genuinely interesting (Active Curiosity)? -> Sprint candidate.
3. Is this maintenance/slop? -> Automate, Delegate, or Delete.

2. TASK SYSTEM DESIGN: THE RETIRED DAD SPRINT

The Concept
Corporate sprints are about output. Your sprints are about intention. A 2-week cycle allows for weather variability and spontaneity without losing focus.

The Toodledo Setup
Simplify your folders to just three core states:
- Active Sprint (Hot List): The 10-15 big rocks for these 2 weeks.
- Routine/Maintenance: Recurring tasks (bills, health checks). Hidden from daily view unless due.
- The Backlog (Icebox): Everything else. Categorized broadly (e.g., "House," "Tech," "Someday").

Handling the Backlog
- You likely have 300+ tasks.
- Action: Declare Bankruptcy. Move ALL non-urgent tasks to a folder named "Old Backlog - Review Later."
- Start fresh. Only pull items out if you actually need them.

The Reviews
- Bi-Weekly Sprint Planning (Sunday, 30 mins):
  - Review calendar (kids' sports, social).
  - Check weather (skiing/sailing windows).
  - Pick 3-5 "Big Rocks" for the sprint.
  - Fill rest with necessary maintenance.

- Weekly Check-in (Sunday, 15 mins):
  - Quick course correction.
  - Did skiing bump a task? Move it to next week or drop it.

- Daily Standup (Morning coffee, 5 mins):
  - Look at "Active Sprint" list.
  - Pick 1-2 wins for today.
  - Check Henry's briefing.

3. PRIORITY INTEGRATION

The "Variable Schedule"
- Your schedule is dictated by external factors (Weather, School, Health).
- Fixed Blocks: Kids' logistics, known social events.
- Floating Blocks: Training and Adventure.
  - If Powder Alert > 15cm: Skiing overrides desk tasks.
  - If Wind > 15 knots: Sailing/Foiling overrides chores.

Seasonal Modes
- Winter Mode: Ski priority. Evenings are for recovery/family. Tech projects happen on storm days or poor visibility days.
- Summer Mode: Sailing/Triathlon priority. Longer days allow for morning training and evening social time.

4. AUTOMATION (HENRY III'S ROLE)

I can handle the friction so you don't have to look at Toodledo constantly.

Morning Briefing
- I will digest your calendar and weather.
- "Paul, it's a powder day (20cm). Ailie has soccer at 4 PM. Your only hard deadline is the tax call at 2 PM."

Triage Assistance
- Once a week, I can scan your "Inbox" for keywords.
- "You added 5 links to YouTube videos. Delete them or schedule 1 hour to watch all?"

Proactive Alerts
- "Wind forecast looks perfect for Thursday afternoon. Block it off now?"
- "You haven't had a social dinner in 10 days. Text [Friend Name]?"

5. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

Phase 1: The Purge (Week 1)
- Create "Old Backlog" folder in Toodledo.
- Select All -> Move to "Old Backlog."
- Create new folders: "Active Sprint," "Maintenance," "Icebox."
- Breathe.

Phase 2: The Setup (Week 1-2)
- define the "Routine" tasks (recurring items).
- Set up the Family Calendar sync if not already tight.
- Configure Henry for morning briefings.

Phase 3: Sprint One (Weeks 2-4)
- Pick just 3 goals. (e.g., "Fix garage rack," "Ski 3 days," "Config AI agent").
- Run the cycle.
- Fail, learn, adjust.
