# Weekly Planning Process

## When
- Sunday evening or Monday morning
- Can be triggered by: "let's plan the week" or via heartbeat/cron

## Steps (in order)

### 1. Kids' Events (TOP PRIORITY)
- Pull Jen's calendar for the week (she has all kids' logistics)
- Pull Paul's calendar for existing commitments
- Note: Parker (St. Thomas Aquinas), Ailie (Seycove)
- Key items: school drop-off/pickup, sports (soccer, basketball, track), practices, games
- Flag any events Paul needs to attend or drive for

### 2. Ski Forecast
- Check snow-forecast.com (logged in via browser cookies, premium account)
- URL: https://www.snow-forecast.com/resorts/Whistler-Blackcomb/6day/mid
- Also check: Mt Seymour, Grouse, Cypress for local options
- Look for: best snow day, clearest weather, coldest temps (good snow)
- Paul's commitment: ski at least once per week
- Pick the best day, overlay with kids' calendar to confirm Paul is free

### 3. Weather & eFoiling
- Check North Vancouver weather (wttr.in or similar)
- Warmest, calmest wind day = eFoil day
- Goal: 1 ski + 1 eFoil per week (season dependent)

### 4. Boat Days
- Typically Tuesday and Friday, after school drop-off until ~3 PM
- Good for: coaching sessions (Tameca), focused work, eFoiling departure point
- Block as free (not busy) on calendar

### 5. Appointments
- Check pending DFU tasks for follow-ups due this week
- Check email for replies from practitioners (Abbie, Tameca, Mel waitlist)
- Offer available boat day time slots for coaching/appointments

### 6. Open Slots = Task Time
- Whatever's left after kids, skiing, eFoiling, boat, appointments
- These are the windows for tackling Toodledo tasks
- Flag the open slots explicitly: "You have Wed 2-5 PM and Thu is full"

## Calendar Conventions
- Activity blocks (skiing, eFoiling, boat) marked as FREE (not busy)
- Use emoji in titles: 🎿 ⛷ 🏄 🚤
- Kids' events are on Jen's calendar as source of truth

## Output Format
Present as a simple week view:
- Mon: [commitments] | Open: [time slots]
