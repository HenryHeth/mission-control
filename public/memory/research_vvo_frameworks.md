## Top 3 Recommended Frameworks (with Quiz/Scored Assessment)

### 1. 🏆 Hyatt Full Focus System (Best Year Ever + Living Forward + LifeScore)

**The Framework:**
Michael Hyatt's integrated system is the closest match to the VVO hierarchy. It combines three complementary tools:
- **Living Forward** (book w/ Daniel Harkavy): Create a Life Plan — define your vision, identify life domains, clarify values, set priorities
- **Your Best Year Ever** (book): 5-step goal achievement system — Believe the Possibility → Complete the Past → Design Your Future → Find Your Why → Make It Happen
- **Full Focus Planner**: Daily/weekly execution tool that cascades goals → tasks

**The Assessment:**
- **LifeScore™ Assessment** — FREE, online, ~10-15 minutes
- URL: https://assessments.fullfocus.co/lifescore/
- Scores you 1-100 across **10 life domains**: Spiritual, Intellectual, Emotional, Physical, Relational, Parental, Social, Vocational, Avocational, Financial
- 72 questions total, choose phrases that best describe you
- Produces a visual radar chart + domain-specific scores
- Gives score-specific report with tips and strategies

**Goal Framework:** SMARTER Goals (Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Risky, Time-keyed, Exciting, Relevant) — an enhancement of SMART

**VVO Alignment:**
| VVO Level | Hyatt Equivalent |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Vision | Life Plan vision statement (from Living Forward) |
| Values | Core values identified in Life Plan process |
| Objectives | Life domain priorities (informed by LifeScore) |
| Goals | SMARTER goals across domains (7-10 per year) |
| Tasks | Full Focus Planner daily Big 3 tasks |

**Pros:**
- ✅ Most complete vision-to-task cascade of any framework
- ✅ FREE scored assessment (LifeScore) available right now
- ✅ Explicitly starts with values/vision before goals
- ✅ 10 life domains prevent tunnel-visioning on just career
- ✅ Practical execution tools (Full Focus Planner)
- ✅ 5-step system is structured and repeatable annually
- ✅ Strong community, live events, GPT-based Goal Achievement Assistant
- ✅ Books are accessible and actionable

**Cons:**
- ❌ Full ecosystem is $$$: planner ($40-60/quarter), live events ($500+), courses
- ❌ LifeScore is surface-level (rates current state, doesn't deeply probe values)
- ❌ Values clarification process is in the books, not the free assessment
- ❌ Can feel like a product funnel (assessment → planner → course → event)
- ❌ Somewhat Christian-influenced (may or may not fit)

**Verdict:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Best overall fit for VVO. Start with the FREE LifeScore assessment to see where you stand, then use Living Forward for the deeper vision/values work.

### 2. 🥈 Covey 7 Habits + FranklinCovey Tools (PEQ + Mission Statement Builder)

**The Framework:**
Stephen Covey's classic framework is arguably the OG of vision → values → goals life planning. The 7 Habits cascade from inner effectiveness to outer effectiveness:
- **Private Victory** (Habits 1-3): Be Proactive → Begin With the End in Mind → Put First Things First
- **Public Victory** (Habits 4-6): Think Win/Win → Seek First to Understand → Synergize
- **Renewal** (Habit 7): Sharpen the Saw

Habit 2 ("Begin With the End in Mind") is the heart of VVO — it's about writing a **personal mission statement** based on your deepest values, then using that as the "constitution" for all decisions.

**The Assessments:**
1. **Personal Effectiveness Quotient (PEQ)** — FREE, online, scored
   - URL: https://7habitspeq.com/
   - Scores you on each of the 7 Habits + overall effectiveness
   - Categories: Private Victory, Public Victory, Sharpen the Saw
   - Identifies specific habits to improve

2. **Mission Statement Builder** — FREE, online, guided
   - URL: https://msb.franklincovey.com/
   - Walks you through identifying passions, values, life goals
   - Outputs a personal mission statement, team mission, or family mission
   - Three tracks: Personal, Team, Family

**VVO Alignment:**
| VVO Level | Covey Equivalent |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Vision | Personal Mission Statement (Habit 2) |
| Values | Core principles/values identified in mission process |
| Objectives | Life roles (spouse, parent, professional, etc.) |
| Goals | Role-specific goals aligned to mission |
| Tasks | Weekly planning: Big Rocks first (Habit 3) |

**Pros:**
- ✅ Two FREE assessments/tools available
- ✅ PEQ gives scored baseline across all 7 Habits
- ✅ Mission Statement Builder is genuinely useful for values clarification
- ✅ Framework is principle-centered, not trend-dependent
- ✅ 35+ years of validation, universally applicable
- ✅ Roles-based approach prevents work-life imbalance
- ✅ "Begin With the End in Mind" is literally the VVO philosophy
- ✅ Available as book, audiobook, courses, app

**Cons:**
- ❌ PEQ measures habit effectiveness, not values/vision clarity directly
- ❌ No single assessment covers vision → values → goals cascade
- ❌ Framework is broad philosophy, less prescriptive on goal mechanics
- ❌ Mission Statement Builder doesn't score you — it's a guided writing tool
- ❌ Book is dense (300+ pages) — takes commitment to absorb
- ❌ No built-in annual review/goal-setting cycle like Hyatt
- ❌ FranklinCovey training is expensive ($1000+) for the full course

**Verdict:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Strongest philosophical foundation for VVO. The PEQ + Mission Statement Builder combo gives you both a scored assessment AND values clarification. Best if Paul wants deep, principle-based thinking rather than a quick system.

### 3. 🥉 Ikigai Framework (Ikigai-9 + Purpose Discovery Quizzes)

**The Framework:**
The Japanese concept of ikigai ("a reason for being") maps the intersection of four circles:
- **What you LOVE** (Passion)
- **What you're GOOD AT** (Vocation/Talent)
- **What the WORLD NEEDS** (Mission)
- **What you can be PAID FOR** (Profession)

Where all four overlap = your Ikigai. The intersections also produce:
- Passion + Talent = Satisfaction but no wealth
- Talent + Payment = Comfortable but unfulfilled
- Payment + Mission = Excitement but uncertainty
- Mission + Passion = Delight but insecurity

**The Assessments:**
1. **Ikigai-9 Scale** — FREE, validated, 9-item scored questionnaire
   - Academically validated by Fido, Kotera, & Asano (2019)
   - Measures three dimensions: Optimistic emotions toward life, Active attitudes toward future, Meaning of existence
   - 9 statements scored on a Likert scale
   - Simple but psychometrically robust

2. **Ikigai Test (ikigaitest.com)** — FREE, online, visual results
   - URL: https://ikigaitest.com/
   - Produces a personal Ikigai diagram with Mission, Passion, Profession, Vocation
   - Includes personality type and career suggestions

3. **IDRLabs Ikigai Test** — FREE, visual
   - URL: https://www.idrlabs.com/ikigai/test.php
   - Structured reflection on passion, talent, values, livelihood

**VVO Alignment:**
| VVO Level | Ikigai Equivalent |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Vision | Your Ikigai (the center intersection) |
| Values | What you love + What the world needs |
| Objectives | The four circles and their intersections |
| Goals | Activities/careers that fit your Ikigai |
| Tasks | *(not explicitly covered — needs supplementing)* |

**Pros:**
- ✅ Ikigai-9 is academically validated and FREE
- ✅ Multiple free online quizzes available
- ✅ Powerful for discovering purpose and values
- ✅ Visual model (4 circles) is intuitive and memorable
- ✅ Culturally rich, holistic, non-corporate feel
- ✅ Great for career transitions and life reorientation
- ✅ Research links ikigai to better physical and mental health
- ✅ Addresses meaning AND practicality (includes "paid for")

**Cons:**
- ❌ WEAK on goal/task cascade — tells you what, not how to execute
- ❌ Ikigai-9 measures current ikigai level, not a values discovery tool per se
- ❌ Online quizzes vary wildly in quality
- ❌ No built-in planning system, planner, or execution framework
- ❌ Framework is primarily career/purpose oriented, not full-life
- ❌ Can feel abstract without a coaching guide
- ❌ Needs to be paired with another system for Goals → Tasks

**Verdict:** ⭐⭐⭐½ Excellent for the Vision and Values layers of VVO. The Ikigai-9 is the most scientifically validated instrument of any framework here. Best used as a starting point for values/purpose discovery, then pair with Hyatt or Covey for the goals/tasks cascade.

## Honorable Mentions (Considered but Not Top 3)

### Tony Robbins — Wheel of Life + RPM System
- **Quiz:** Wheel of Life assessment (free, scored, at tonyrobbins.com/quiz/wheel-of-life)
- **Framework:** RPM = Results → Purpose → Massive Action Plan
- **Why not top 3:** Focuses more on motivation/state management than values clarification. Wheel of Life is a snapshot tool, not a deep values discovery process. RPM is powerful for execution but assumes you already know your vision/values. The Robbins ecosystem is also very expensive and sales-heavy.

### Simon Sinek — Golden Circle (Start With Why)
- **Quiz:** ❌ NO scored quiz or assessment
- **Framework:** Why → How → What (purpose → process → output)
- **Why not top 3:** No assessment component. "Find Your Why" (companion book) has a guided discovery process but it's partner-based (requires another person to interview you). Framework is primarily organizational/leadership focused, not personal life planning. Great philosophy but lacks tools.

### VIA Character Strengths Survey
- **Quiz:** ✅ FREE, scored, 15-20 min, identifies top character strengths from 24 validated traits
- **URL:** https://www.viacharacter.org/survey/account/register
- **Why not top 3:** Identifies strengths, not values or vision. Excellent complement to any of the top 3 (especially for the "Values" layer), but doesn't provide a planning framework. No goals/tasks cascade.

### CliftonStrengths (StrengthsFinder 2.0)
- **Quiz:** ✅ Scored assessment, identifies top 5 of 34 talent themes
- **Why not top 3:** PAID ($20-50), focuses on talents/strengths not values/vision. Workplace-oriented. No life planning framework. Best as a supplement, not primary.

### SparkVision Core Values Quiz
- **Quiz:** ✅ FREE, categorizes values into "This Drives Me" / "I Wish This Drove Me" / "This Describes Me" / "Does Not Resonate"
- **URL:** https://corevaluesquiz.com/
- **Why not top 3:** Values-only tool with no framework for cascading to objectives/goals/tasks. However, it's an excellent standalone values clarification exercise that could supplement any of the top 3.
